- Fix some magic numbers in default window creation, scene camera creation. Both are 800, 600, should be linked somehow.
 - Build on Linux (change "glfw/glfw3.h" to "GLFW/glfw3.h")
 - no way to tell if Texture::loadFromFile failed
 - no +=, -=, etc operators on Vec3
 - no standard output for Vec3
 - Vec3::zero and standard normals would be useful
 - Vec distance function
 - Texture loading only works with 32 bit depth textures
 - Math.Abs, Math.Clamp, Math.Lerp, Sqrt
 - Random numbers
 - Screen to world coords, world to screen
 - round float
